# Test_OpenXR

I have a different base rotation for my controllers (Quest 2).
With the Oculus XR it's working fine, the rotation are good but when i've switched to OpenXR the rotation was not the same like 30Â° difference on the X axis.
And on the top of it, when i launch steamVR, the position and rotation are good but in Unity they don't match.
